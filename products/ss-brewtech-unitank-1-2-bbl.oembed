The unitank gives the brewer the ability to quickly carb beer in under 24 hours using the carb stone, while precisely monitoring head pressure. Features that until now were only available on our Ss Brite Tank for home brewers. Then perform a true pressurized and closed transfer to a serving vessel, keg, counter pressure bottle filler, or canning machine. Closed transfers significantly reduce the chances of oxidation when compared to open transfers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher pressure limits also gives the user the ability to filter beer directly out of the vessel into one of the aforementioned packaging methods. Lastly, a unitank with the addition of a spunding valve also gives the brewer the ability to ferment under pressure, which is gaining in popularity. In that same vein, the brewer can use the final few gravity points left of active fermentation to naturally carbonate their beer instead of force carbonate. The added feature set and flexibility is why pro brewers use unitanks in their brewing and packaging processes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSs Brewtech designs all of their products with safety as an overarching concern, which is one reason why these vessels are vigorously tested at 4x their recommended operating pressure. Once the fabrication of the first production golden sample is complete, the unit is sent to a lab, where it undergoes a series of tests to insure that the vessel conforms to our strict standards. These tests are performed in a lab environment by SGS, a global leader in inspection, verification, and testing certifications.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBest in class 30 psi max operating pressure\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFully welded TC flanges\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCombination 3” TC dry hop, CIP, and PRV port\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e3” TC cap \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ewith\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e PRV\u003c\/span\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC carb stone with 3\/8” ball valve\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC blow off cane with welded blow off arm mount\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC to ½” ball valve for blow off cane\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC pro sanitary pressure gauge\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC pro sanitary sampling valve\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1.5” TC thermowell with LCD thermometer\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e6” TC lid with fully welded chiller coil\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneoprene insulation jacket\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eButterfly valves with racking arm\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStainless lower shelf\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003eAdjustable feet\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpecs:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e304 Stainless construction\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor 15.5 gallon batches\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e43.5\" Tall (floor to pressure gauge)\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e30 PSI max pressure, 15 PSI operating pressure\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e19.0\" Max width\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/StBO8B1vftw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c\/iframe\u003e","brand":"Ss Brewtech","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":29370243874918,"sku":"78422","price":1899.99,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/2278\/3341\/products\/78422_SSUNITANKHALFBBL.jpg?v=1562331345","url":"https:\/\/bestcasediy.ca\/products\/ss-brewtech-unitank-1-2-bbl","provider":"Best Case DIY","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
