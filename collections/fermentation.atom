<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FTSs² uses a precision temperature controller that constantly monitors the temperature of your fermentation to within 1° of its set point. When the temperature of your beer rises by over 1° the system kicks in and circulates your chill source liquid through the chiller coil until temperature is stabilized. The FTSs² system also incorporates a heating pad so if temperature of your beer drops the controller will activate the system to gently warm the beer back up to the controller’s set point.</span></p>

<p>The most affordable pressurized fermenter on the market! While the All Rounder does not have a dump valve as the Fermzilla Conical does, it is pressure rated to the same 36.2 psi. That makes it the most affordable pressurized fermenter you can find!<br></p>
<p>Made of super smooth, crystal clear PET means it is light weight and impossible to smash like glass. Plus the extra wide 4.75 inch opening means it's easy to clean.</p>
<p><strong>What's Included:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FermZilla 30L All Rounder Fermenter</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Stand</li>
<li>Stainless Steel Handle</li>
<li>Top Lid with PRV (35 psi)</li>
<li>3-Piece Airlock</li>
<li>Adhesive Thermometer</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ef3e36;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>:</span> This tank should not be used for hot liquid.  Do not put liquids inside this tank over 50C.  It will melt the tank.</p>
<p><em>Occasionally these units may come with some small indentations/dimples/dents from shipping, this is just a reality of shipping large blow-moulded thin-walled vessels. These fermenters are designed to endure minor deformations such as this. This was a necessary implementation into the design so that they can withstand some accidental suction from cold crashing and rough handling in transit without compromising their integrity and ability to endure high pressures. All small dents will push out and settle with use and positive pressure and are only an issue and are a warrant replacement in the rare event they start to show white stress patterns or have damaged the plastic.</em></p>

<div>Le fermenteur pressurisé le plus abordable du marché! Bien que le All Rounder n'ait pas de soupape de décharge comme le fait le Fermzilla Conical, il a une pression nominale de 36,2 psi. Cela en fait le fermenteur pressurisé le plus abordable que vous puissiez trouver! Tout ce dont vous avez besoin est d'ajouter le kit Fermzilla Pressure pour faire fermenter sous pression. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Fabriqué en PET ultra lisse et cristallin, il est léger et impossible à casser comme du verre. De plus, l'ouverture extra large de 4,75 pouces signifie qu'il est facile à nettoyer. </div>

<div><i>Parfois, ces unités peuvent être accompagnées de petites indentations / fossettes / bosses dues à l'expédition, ce n'est qu'une réalité de l'expédition de grands navires à parois minces moulés par soufflage. Ces fermenteurs sont conçus pour supporter des déformations mineures comme celle-ci. Il s'agissait d'une mise en œuvre nécessaire dans la conception afin qu'ils puissent résister à une aspiration accidentelle due à des chocs à froid et à une manipulation brutale en transit sans compromettre leur intégrité et leur capacité à supporter des pressions élevées. Toutes les petites bosses vont pousser et s'installer avec l'utilisation et la pression positive et ne sont qu'un problème et sont un remplacement de garantie dans les rares cas où elles commencent à montrer des motifs de stress blancs ou ont endommagé le plastique.  </i></div></td>

But with all the tweaks that make it the most cost effective conical fermenter to date! \n\nThe FermZilla has primarily been designed as a pressure fermentation, carbonation and dispensing vessel. To convert this vessel into a pressurised uni tank you will need to purchase 1 x - Stainless Steel Pressure Kit or the 1 x Premium Plastic Pressure Kit \nFermZilla -  27L\n\nThe new and improved FermZilla 27L brought to you by the critical key minds and engineers behind the original Gen1. But with all the tweaks that make it the most cost-effective conical fermenter to date! \n\nWe have discontinued selling the Fermentasaurus as the new FermZilla is here.  The new FermZilla is a revolution in home brewing allowing home brewers and small micro-breweries a level of control that meets everyone's budget.  With the FermZilla you have the many of the benefits of a much more expensive stainless conical fermenter but with the additional benefit of being able to see the fermentation process in action and also ferment at pressures up to 2.4bar.\n\nThis is an incredible product at an extremely attractive price point and available in FermZilla 27L and FermZilla 55L sizes.\n\n\nAdd the optional pressure kit to your FermZilla 27L and turn your FermZilla into a true uni tank. \nUni tanks are conical fermenters used both for fermentation and for carbonating and serving finished beer. \nThis extremely inexpensive upgrade will truly show you what the FermZilla was designed for\nKB01297 - FermZilla - Stainless Steel Pressure Kit\nor the NEW KB02113 - KegLand Red Plastic FermZilla Pressure Kit\nboth compatible with the Conical and All-Rounder Models in all sizes.\n\nThese units were designed for use with CO2.\n\nNew and Improved:\n1. Larger Dump Valve\n2. Larger opening\n3. Pressure rating 2.4bar (35psi)\n4.

You must perform a water pressure check to ensure your connections are leak proof. To do this. Fill your FermZilla up with water, then apply a minimum of 15psi pressure to the vessel. Check for leaks around all Cap / Threads.\n\nOccasionally these units may come with some small indentations/dimples/dents from shipping, this is just a reality of shipping large blow-moulded thin-walled vessels. But dont panic, these fermenters are designed to endure minor deformations such as this.
